# Password_OP

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite.

Developed a full-stack password manager using the MERN stack to store and manage user credentials. Built RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express, integrated MongoDB for persistent storage, and connected the backend with a React frontend for performing CRUD operations on saved passwords. The project strengthened my understanding of API design, database integration, and full-stack workflow.
